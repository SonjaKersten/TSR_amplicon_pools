# PacBio TSR amplicon pools


This directory contains both bash and R scripts organized by the Figure for which they were used, as well as the necessary input files to execute those scripts.     


The simulation runs were performed with the software [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim).
The following scripts for the two different dominant coefficients were used:
- TSR_lasting_0.25.slim 
- TSR_lasting_0.5.slim
- with the param_file.txt containing all input parameter combination used.

These are the concatenated output files of all 400 runs per parameter combination:
- All_runs_42000_0.5.txt.zip
- All_runs_42000_0.25.txt.zip
