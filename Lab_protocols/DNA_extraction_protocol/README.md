## Extraction protocol

The following extraction protocol can be used for plates or tubes. The first step for tissue grinding is always performed in 2 ml screw cap micro tubes. From then on the standard protocol assumes plates. Alternative parameters for extraction in tubes are indicated as **'**.

### 1. Lysis and precipitation

  **1.1.** Collect ca. 300 mg of plant material. Grind the frozen (liquid N) tissue in the screw cap micro tubes (filled with 4-5 ceramic beads) with the Fast Prep machine at speed 4 for 15 sec. Freeze again in liquid N and repeat grinding.
  
  **1.2.** Quickly add 800 uL of extraction buffer to the screw cap micro tubes and vortex until homogenized.
  
  **1.3.** Incubation for 1 hour at 60 °C.
  
  **1.4.** [Plate] Spin at max speed ~6,000 g for plates for 10 min.
  
  **1.4.'** [Tube] Spin at 12 000 g for 1 min.
  
  **1.5.** [Plate] Transfer 200 ul supernatant to a QIAgen collection microtube plate and add 0.325 volumes of 5M Potassium Acetate (65ul for 200ul lysate). **Note: The remaining lysate (ca. 400 ul) can be frozen again in -80 °C (as backup) and if needed used later from this step on.**
  
  **1.5.'** [Tube] Transfer 200 ul supernatant to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube and add 0.325 volumes of 5M Potassium Acetate (65ul for 200ul lysate).
  
  **1.6.** Close the plate/ tube, mix it very well and give it a short spin.
  
  **1.7.** Incubate the plate/ tube in -20 C for 10 - 15 min.
  
  **1.8.** [Plate] Spin at max speed ~6,000 g for plates for 10 min.
  
  **1.8.'** [Tube] Spin at 12 000 g for 1 min.
  
  **1.9.** [Plate] Transfer 200 uL of supernatant to a fresh QIAgen collection microtube plate. **Note: Remove the bottom lid of the plate to fit it on a magnet.**
  
  **1.9.'** [Tube] Transfer 200 uL of supernatant to a fresh 2 ml tube.

### 2. First bead-cleanup

  **2.1.** Add 300 uL of magnetic beads, mix it well by pipetting up and down and give it 5 min incubation at RT to bind to the beads.
  
  **2.2.** Place on the magnetic stand for 5 min or until beads are bound to the side.
  
  **2.3.** Remove and discard supernatant, leaving plate/ tube on the magnetic stand.
  
  **2.4.** Add 500 uL fresh 80% EtOH to wash the beads, while keeping the plate/ tube on the magnet, wait 30 s and remove and discard EtOH.
  
  **2.5.** Repeat the 80% EtOH wash and carefully remove all remaining EtOH. **Note: Sometimes it is good to flash spin and put the tubes back on the magnet and remove the last ul of EtOH with a pipet.**
  
  **2.6.** Let the beads dry for 2 min. **Note: Don’t overdry the beads as this can lead to substantial DNA losses.**
  
  **2.7.** Add 52 uL H2O and resuspend the beads by pipetting or with a plate shaker.
  
  **2.8.** Incubate 5 min at room temperature.
  
  **2.9.** Place on a magnetic stand for 5 min or until beads are stuck to the side.
  
  **2.10** Transfer 50 ul supernatant (containing the DNA) to a PCR plate.

### 3. Second bead-cleanup

**Note: The second bead-cleanup is not necessary for all plant species. With only one cleanup for ALOMY not all following PCR reactions worked. Probably due to secondary inhibiting phytochemicals.  With the additional cleanup, all PCR reactions worked.**

  **3.1.** Add 50 ul of magnetic beads to each well, mix it well by pipetting up and down and give it 5 min incubation at RT to bind to the beads.
  
  **3.2.** Repeat steps 2.2 until 2.10. For the 80% EtOH washes, 200 ul are sufficient this time.
