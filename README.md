# Deep haplotype analyses of target-site resistance locus ACCase in blackgrass enabled by pool-based amplicon sequencing

PacBio long-range TSR amplicons of the *ACCase* gene in blackgrass pools (*Alopecurus myosuroides*). Workflow with hands-on lab protocol and post processing of PacBio long-read sequences with the clustering software [*pbaa*](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbAA) developed by Zev Kronenberg, Armin TÃ¶pfer and John Harting.
